*Please report issues found or suggestions in the [project issues page](https://github.com/ayoayco/astro-github-stats/issues)*

### Usage
Install on your Astro project:

```
npm i astro-github-stats
```

Then use on your Astro page:

```astro
---
import GithubStats from 'astro-github-stats';
---
<GithubStats username="ayoayco" />
```

### Future plans
Initially this is a wrapper for [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) supporting the basic github account stats card. Other features can be supported later, depending on demand:
1. repo cards
1. themes
1. account top languages
